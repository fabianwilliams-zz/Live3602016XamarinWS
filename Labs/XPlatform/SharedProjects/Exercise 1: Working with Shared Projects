Exercise 1: Working with Shared Projects

Duration:
20 minutes

Lab Goals
The primary goal of this exercise will be to load some JSON data in from a file and use it as a source to display information in an iOS, Android and Windows Phone application. The code to manage the loading of the file will be completely shared between the projects using a Shared Project.

We will need to do the following steps

Create a new Shared Project.
Add 2 shared source files (Song.cs and SongLoader.cs) to the shared project - these have already been written for you and are in the lab resources folder.
Add a reference to the Shared Project to each of your target projects (see the above note about Visual Studio)
Add a Nuget reference to Newtonsoft's Json.net parser which is used by the shared project code into each target project.
Add a data file into each of the target projects which is processed by the shared code.
Accessing local files in iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8

Modify the shared code to properly load the file based on the platform.
