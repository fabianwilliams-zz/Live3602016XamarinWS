This full day workshop will look at Xamarin as a technology for Mobile App development. It will also cover Xamarin.Forms, which sits atop the Xamarin platform. Specifically, you'll examine the architecture of a Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms App originating from the Mac Side as the experience is different from a Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Droid & Xamarin.Forms solution. You'll go into details as to how Views (Controls), Layouts, and Pages are coded to present a usable Mobile App, specifically mixing and matching Navigation Pages, Master Detail Pages, Tabbed Pages and different controls, with Stack Layouts. You'll also learn how Xamarin integrates seamlessly into Azure workloads such as Windows Azure Mobile Services (WAMS). This lets you perform CRUD operations to the back end systems through the mobile experience across all platforms.

You will learn:

How to leverage your knowledge as a C# developer with a small learning curve to build mobile applications, actual Native Mobile Applications for iOS, Android, and Windows
How you can surface data with ease and perform CRUD operations using Azure Mobile Services and Azure Cloud Services
How to build targeted platform specific solutions or cross platform mobile applications for your workforce
